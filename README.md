# A Hierarchical XGBoost Early Detection Method for Quality and Productivity Improvement of Electronics Manufacturing Systems
This repo holds the XGBoost methods part of my solution to the PHME Data Challenge 2022 [Github Challenge link](https://github.com/PHME-Datachallenge/Data-Challenge-2022), [Conference Challenge Link](https://phm-europe.org/data-challenge)

Most of my effort was spent on training model that predict a system level sanction with subsystem levels inputs both continuous and categorical

# Train task model

1. Get the code and move to the code directory.
2. Install python packages as specified in [requirement.txt](https://github.com/alexandregft/PHME-data-contest/blob/main/requirement.txt).
3. Run notebook Training_taskX.ipynb


# Test task model
1. Get the code and move to the code directory.
2. Install python packages as specified in [requirement.txt](https://github.com/alexandregft/PHME-data-contest/blob/main/requirement.txt).
3. Run notebook solution.ipynb in the folder Testing
